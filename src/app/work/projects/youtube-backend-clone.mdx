## Overview

I developed a crop disease detection platform that classifies diseases in wheat, rice, maize, and sugarcane using deep learning models. This system helps farmers identify plant diseases early and accurately through a mobile app powered by AI.

## Key Features

- *Multimodel Architecture*: Trained and deployed separate CNN-based models for each crop type to improve accuracy.
- *Disease Classification*: Detects specific diseases like leaf blight, rust, and bacterial spots across different crop types.
- *Flutter Integration*: Integrated the models into a mobile app frontend built using Flutter and Dart.
- *TensorFlow Models*: Each model was saved as an `.h5` file and loaded dynamically based on selected crop type.
- *Offline Functionality*: Ensured the models could run on-device without needing internet access for predictions.

## Technologies Used

- *Deep Learning*: TensorFlow, Keras
- *Model Format*: .h5
- *Frontend*: Flutter (Dart)
- *Deployment*: Android APK with embedded models

## Challenges and Solutions

A major challenge was handling multiple crop types with differing data distributions. I tackled this by creating modular pipelines and training crop-specific models to boost classification accuracy. Another challenge was optimizing models to run efficiently on mobile devices, which I addressed through quantization and pruning.

## Outcome

The platform:
- Achieved over 90% test accuracy on all models
- Enabled farmers to detect diseases offline
- Reduced dependency on expert visits for basic diagnoses

This project showcases my ability to combine AI, mobile development, and agricultural insights into a scalable and user-friendly solution.
