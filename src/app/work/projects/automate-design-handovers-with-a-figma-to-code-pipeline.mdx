## Overview

I developed a smart invoice analysis tool that extracts structured insights from multilingual invoices using Google's Gemini Pro 2.5. The system supports image uploads and natural language queries, enabling users to ask questions like "What is the total amount?" or "What is the invoice date?" and get accurate responses in real time.

## Key Features

- *Image Upload*: Supports uploading invoice images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG formats
- *Prompt-based Querying*: Users can ask natural language questions about invoice content
- *Multilingual Support*: Works with invoices in Urdu, Spanish, French, and more
- *LLM-Vision Integration*: Leverages Gemini Pro 2.5 for multimodal input understanding
- *User Interface*: Built using Streamlit for a responsive and intuitive experience

## Technologies Used

- *Frontend*: Streamlit
- *Backend AI*: Google Gemini Pro 2.5
- *Environment Management*: Python, virtualenv
- *Secrets Management*: `.env` file for API key

## Challenges and Solutions

A key challenge was ensuring the model accurately extracted relevant information across different languages and invoice formats. I addressed this by experimenting with prompt engineering and fallback parsing strategies. I also implemented input validation and basic error handling to enhance robustness.

## Outcome

The application:
- Enables document-level interaction via text and image inputs
- Delivers fast, accurate invoice information extraction
- Supports global invoice formats through multilingual capabilities

This project showcases my expertise in combining LLMs, vision models, and Streamlit for real-world automation tools in finance and operations.
