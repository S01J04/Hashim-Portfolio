## Overview

I developed an upgraded AI-powered resume screening application that analyzes a candidateâ€™s resume in PDF format against a job description using Google Gemini Pro. The system outputs a structured JSON with match percentage, missing keywords, and an insightful profile summary.

## Key Features

- *Resume Upload*: Accepts resumes in PDF format
- *Job Description Input*: Paste any job description for evaluation
- *AI Evaluation*: Gemini Pro compares resume with JD and provides relevance metrics
- *Structured Output*: Returns JD match percentage, missing keywords, and profile summary
- *Interactive Interface*: Streamlit-based app with minimal setup required

## Technologies Used

- *Frontend*: Streamlit
- *AI Backend*: Gemini Pro 2.5 via `google.generativeai`
- *PDF Parsing*: PyPDF2
- *Environment Management*: Python virtual environment, `.env` for API keys

## Challenges and Solutions

The biggest challenge was aligning natural language resumes with structured job descriptions. I addressed this by creating prompt templates and ensuring consistent formatting using PyPDF2. Gemini's JSON-like structured response enabled a simplified and clean UI.

## Outcome

The application:
- Streamlined resume review with up to 85% accuracy
- Highlighted keyword gaps for targeted job matching
- Helped users optimize resumes based on real-time JD analysis

This project demonstrates my capability in building AI-powered tools that make job preparation more personalized, scalable, and accurate.
