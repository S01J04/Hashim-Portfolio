## Overview

I developed **Calories Advisor**, an AI-powered Streamlit web application that helps users evaluate their meals through food image uploads. The system detects food items, estimates calories, and generates a comprehensive health report with nutritional breakdowns and wellness tips.

## Key Features

- *Image Upload*: Accepts food images in JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats
- *Multi-item Detection*: Identifies multiple food items in a single image
- *Calorie Estimation*: Calculates estimated calorie content for each item
- *Meal Health Evaluation*: Provides an overall rating of meal healthiness
- *Nutrient Breakdown*: Displays percentage-wise distribution of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, sugars, and fibers
- *Health Tips*: Offers AI-generated dietary advice based on meal composition

## Technologies Used

- *Frontend*: Streamlit
- *Backend AI*: Google Gemini Pro 2.5 via `google.generativeai`
- *Image Handling*: Pillow
- *Environment Management*: Python virtual environment, `.env` for API key

## Challenges and Solutions

One challenge was balancing inference accuracy with image variability. I addressed this by designing prompt templates optimized for Gemini's multimodal inputs. The system also includes fallback messaging when confidence scores are low.

## Outcome

The application:
- Enabled users to visually assess their food choices
- Simplified nutritional planning without manual input
- Delivered actionable health suggestions instantly

This project highlights my ability to combine vision and language AI in real-world wellness applications, showcasing strong alignment between user experience and intelligent automation.
